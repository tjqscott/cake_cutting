# Readme

This project is a web-based visualisation tool designed to aid in understanding cake-cutting algorithms. It allows users to input agent preferences and observe the step-by-step execution of algorithms, illustrating the concepts of fair division.

## Build instructions

The project utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and can be run in any modern web browser.

### Requirements

* Any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Build steps

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.

    * Note: Documentation for using the tool can be found within the "Documentation ðŸ”—" section in the dropdown menu of the application.

### Test steps

1.  Interact with the tool by inputting agent preferences and running the available algorithms.
2.  Observe the visual representation of the algorithm's execution and verify that the allocations appear fair based on the input preferences.
